        <h1>Express</h1>
            <p>
                Express.js is a minimal and flexible web framework.
                It makes it easy to build web servers and REST APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                You could think of it as this: Express is to Node what Spring Boot is to Java.

        <h2>Setting up an Express project</h2>
            <p>
                To use Express, install the dependency with: <code>npm install express</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then import and initialize it in your project:
            </p>

<pre><code>
// app.js
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
</code></pre>

            <p>
                Now that Express is initialized, you need to configure the port it should listen on:
            </p>

<pre><code>
// app.js
app.listen(8080, () => {
    console.log("running on port 8080");
});
</code></pre>

            <p>
                You're now up and running with your own web server in a few lines of code, easy peasy.
            </p>

        <h2>Routes</h2>
            <p>
                Routes defines how your app responds to different HTTP requests.
                The HTTP methods are as follows: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE
            </p>
            <p>
                Im not gonna explain them in detail here (see REST page),
                but here are some examples on how to use them in your app:
            </p>

<pre><code>
// GET
app.get("/api/friends", (req, res) => {
    const friends = ["John", "Mark", "Oliver"];
    res.send({ data: friends });
});
</code></pre>

            <p>
                This route handles a GET request to <code>/api/friends</code>.
                When the client calls this endpoint, the server will respond with a data object containing the list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, if the client wanted to add a new friend to the list,
                it would look something like this:
            </p>

<pre><code>
// POST
app.post("/api/friends", (req, res) => {
    const newFriend = req.body.name;
    friends.push(newFriend);
    res.status(201).send({ message: `${newFriend} added` })
})
</code></pre>

            <p>
                We use <code>req</code> (request) to access data sent from the client.
                In this case <code>req.body.name</code> from the request body.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>res</code> (response) is the data we send back to the client.
                Here we use the status code 201 to indicate success and <code>send</code> to return a message.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, for POST request, it is important to include:
            </p>

<pre><code>
app.use(express.json())
</code></pre>

            <p>
                This allows Express to read JSON data from the request (body parsing).
            </p>
