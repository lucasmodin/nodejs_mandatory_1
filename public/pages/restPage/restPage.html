        <h1>REST API</h1>
            <p>
                REST is a set of guidelines for building web API's.
                Boiled down, it is basically exposing <strong>resources</strong> (always in nouns),
                over HTTP using standard methods: <strong>GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE</strong> and return data in JSON.

        <h2>Anatomy of a URL</h2>
            <p>
                Before we dive deeper into REST, it is important to understand the anatomy of an URL:
            </p>

<pre><code>
https://www.google.com/search?h1=en&q=pay%20attention
|             |        |
|             |        └─ endpoint
|             └────────── domain
└──────────────────────── protocol  
</code></pre>

            <p>
                The <strong>protocol</strong> (http/https) defines how the client communicates with the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>domain</strong>, where "www" is the <strong>sub-level</strong> and ".com" is the <strong>top-level</strong>, points to the server location.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>endpoint</strong> specifies the resource you want to access.
            </p>
            <p>
                The endpoint could look something like this:
            </p>

<pre><code>
/search?h1=en&q=pay%20attention
|      |______________________|
|                └ query string
└───────────────── path
</code></pre>

            <p>
                The <strong>query</strong> contains query parameters seperated by <code>&amp;</code>
                and starts with a <code>?</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>path</strong> identifies a specific resource.
            </p>

        <h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
            <p>
                We follow an ordering of the HTTP methods:
            </p>

<pre><code>
GET    - retrieve data
POST   - create new data
PUT    - replace existing data
PATCH  - update parts of existing data
DELETE - remove data
</code></pre>

            <p>
                If you look at these methods and think: "that seems familiar" - that's because it is.
                The methods can be directly mapped to the CRUD operations: <strong>Create, Read, Update, Delete</strong>.
            </p>
