        <h1>Node.js</h1>
            <p class="lead muted">
                Node.js is a open source, cross-platform Javascript runtime environment.
                It can run Javascript code outside a web browser, and make server side scripting.
                It represents the "Javascript everywhere" paradigm.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short: we can use Javascript in both <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                (bad news for all you Java-glazers)
            </p>

            <p>
                Fun fact: according to a Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Node.js is one of
                the most commonly used web technologies!
                (translation: you need to learn Node.js!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Fun fact again: Google once made an entire frontend framework where you write 
                <strong>Java</strong> to get <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
                They called it "GWT" - I call it "solving problems that didn't exist".
                (if they wanted type safety, why not just use TypeScript?)

        <h2>npm &amp; package.json</h2>
            <p>
                <code>npm</code> (Node Package Manager) is a tool we use to install, share and manage Javasctipt libraries.
                It comes bundled with Node.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every Node.js project starts with <code>npm init</code>.
                This creates a <code>package.json</code> file that will keep track of your dependencies and scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                You could think of it as <strong>Maven's pom.xml</strong>. They both describe the projects dependencies,
                but npm just keeps things lightweight and human readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>package.json</code> is the heart of every Node project.
                It tells npm which packages to install and defines the scripts you can run with simple commands.
            </p>
