                Node.js is a open source, cross-platform Javascript runtime environment.
                It can run Javascript code outside a web browser, and make server side scripting.
                It represents the "Javascript everywhere" paradigm.

            <p>
                In short: we can use Javascript in both <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong>.

                Fun fact: according to a Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Node.js is one of
                the most commonly used web technologies!
