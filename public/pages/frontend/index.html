                    I'm a Datamatiker student with a strong interest in software development and web technologies.
                    This page is part of my learning process in the subject <strong>Fullstack with Node.js</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It documents my learning journey in the subject.
                    It's a place to collect notes, examples, and small projects as I explore both frontend and backend development.
                    (As of right now, it's only notes).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to gain practical experience and a deeper understanding of <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>,
                    and <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>.
                </p>
