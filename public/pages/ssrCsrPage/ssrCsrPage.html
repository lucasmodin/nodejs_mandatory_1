                In web development rendering is a process that turns website code into
                interactive pages users see when they visit a website.
                For us, that means the HTML, CSS and Javascript code.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is typically done by a rendering engine.
                Now, depending on where that rendering happens, we talk about 
                <strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</strong> or <strong>Client-Side Rendering (CSR)</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Both achieve the same goal, but they do it in different ways.
